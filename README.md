# Scraped Data Presentation Site

Welcome to the Scraped Data Presentation Site repository! This site is designed to complement a data scraper, showcasing the scraped XML data in a user-friendly manner. The associated scraper is located in a separate repository, and the two projects work together seamlessly.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to provide a platform for visualizing and interacting with scraped data. It was created in conjunction with a data scraper project, allowing users to read XML data and save it to a MySQL database with additional metadata.

## Repository Link (Scraper)
For the data scraping part, please refer to the following repository:

## Features
- **Load XML Data:** Easily load and visualize XML data.
- **Read and Explore:** Navigate through the XML structure and view detailed information.
- **Save to MySQL Database:** Save selected data to a MySQL database, including a title and description.

## Usage
To fully utilize this site, integrate it with the associated scraper. The scraper fetches XML data, and this site provides an intuitive interface to interact with and store that data.

## Disclaimer
While this site is designed for practical use, keep in mind that both the scraper and the presentation site were primarily created for educational purposes. They may lack certain production-level features and robustness.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation, and don't forget to check out the associated scraper repository.

Happy coding!
